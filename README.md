Project 1: Call Center Performance Analysis,Diversity and inclusion
What did you discovered?
* Call Center: "Identified peak call times, underperforming agents, and common resolution issues, leading to potential improvements in staffing, training, and first-call resolution rates."
   * Churn: "Pinpointed critical factors contributing to customer churn (e.g., contract type, customer service interactions), enabling targeted retention strategies and potentially reducing churn by [X]%."
   * Diversity & Inclusion: "Highlighted disparities in representation across departments/levels, identified areas for targeted recruitment, and provided a framework for tracking progress towards D&I goals, fostering a more inclusive work environment."
 * Quantify wherever possible! (Even if it's hypothetical for a project, state "potentially saving X" or "leading to X% improvement").
